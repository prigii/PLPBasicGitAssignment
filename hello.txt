Hello, Git

Requirements:

- I already have a GitHub account.

- I already have Git installed on my local machine.

- I use Visual Studio Code.




Step 1: Repository Setup

1. GitHub Repository Creation:

  - Logged in to GitHub account.

  - Created a new repository on GitHub (called it "PLPBasicGitAssignment").

  - Initialized it with a README file.



Step 2: Local Setup

2. Local Folder Setup:

  - Created a new folder on my local machine ("PLPBasicGitAssignment").

  - Opened a terminal and navigated to the created folder.



3. Git Initialization:

  - Initialized a new Git repository in my local folder.



4. Connecting to GitHub:

  - Linked my local repository to the GitHub repository I created in Task 1.

   ```

git remote add origin <repository-url>

   ```

   Replaced `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of my GitHub repository.



Step 3: Making Changes

5. Created a File:

  - Inside my local folder, created a new text file ( `hello.txt`).

  - Added a simple text message ("Hello, Git!").



6. Committing Changes:

  - Staged the changes.

   ```bash

   git add hello.txt

   ```

  - Commited the changes.

   ```bash

   git commit -m "Added hello.txt and readme files"

   ```



Step 4: Pushing to GitHub

7. Pushing to GitHub:

  - Pushed the committed changes to my GitHub repository.

   ```bash

   git push -u origin master

   ```



Step 5: Verification

8. Verified on GitHub:

  - Visited my GitHub repository in a web browser and confirm that the `hello.txt` and README.md files and commit message are visible.
